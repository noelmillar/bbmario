<h3>Backbone-Marionette / Require / Node Setup</h3>

This is a quick script I threw together to automate the initial setup of backbone marionette using Node.<br/>

In order to use the script make sure you have Bower installed.<br/>

<strong>Known Issues</strong><br/>

Windows 7 - 'spawn ENOENT' error when using 'exec'<br/>

Feel free to rip this thing up and make it useful!
